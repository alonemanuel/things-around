          When I first opened my Facebook account I liked the official page of
          Nissan, the Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be precise, I "became a fan" of the page, as it was then called. If
          I recall correctly, I remember seeing a few posts by the page.
          Naturally, since the digital realestate was scarce, the algorithm had
          to sacrifice posts by Nissan to make room for other posts &mdash;
          bands I liked, movies I watched, football players I admired.
        </p>
        <p>
            15 years later &mdash; a few months ago, I decided to tidy my cluttered
            Facebook feed so I can get more relevant content. I unfollowed
            dozens of pages that were no longer interesting for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly, I started getting posts by Nissan in my feed. I couldn't
            really remember when and why I liked their page. It was probably
            because of my dad's red Nissan Micra that I loved since I was a kid.

            Posts about new cars, greetings for Christmas and for Hannuka and other
            corporational ads, I got them all. Soon I started noticing a curious
            pattern. The page had 22 Million likes (and thus followers), and yet
            each post got an average of 4 comments and 30 likes. The top posts
            could get 210 likes, but I don't think I ever saw one that had more
            than 8 comments. Some of them were left uncommented.

            This is approximately a 0.00000136363% of interaction. To put this
            in perspective, a person with 800 friends on Facebook that gets an
            average of 2 comments on his posts, has 0.0025% of comment interaction. If
            Nissan had 0.0025% of interaction, each post would get an average of
            55,000 comments.
